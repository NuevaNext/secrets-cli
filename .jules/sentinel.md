## 2026-02-01 - Argument Injection in CLI Wrappers
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled positional arguments (like emails or secret names) starting with hyphens could be interpreted as flags by underlying CLI tools (`gpg`, `pass`), leading to argument injection.
**Learning:** Wrapping external CLI tools requires careful handling of positional arguments. Even if `exec.Command` prevents shell injection, it doesn't prevent the target binary from misinterpreting arguments as flags.
**Prevention:** Always use the `--` separator to explicitly mark the end of flags and the beginning of positional arguments when calling external binaries with user-provided data.
## 2026-01-31 - Path Traversal and Argument Injection in Secrets CLI
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal in `key add` and `vault create` commands allowed arbitrary file writes via manipulated email or vault names. Additionally, missing `--` separators in GPG/Pass wrappers allowed argument injection.
**Learning:** CLI tools that construct file paths from user arguments are susceptible to traversal if not explicitly sanitized. Positional arguments starting with hyphens can also be misinterpreted as flags by underlying tools.
**Prevention:** Use a centralized validation function to reject dangerous characters (`..`, `/`, `\`) and leading hyphens in names. Always use the `--` delimiter to separate options from positional arguments when calling external binaries.
## 2026-02-18 - Input Validation and Argument Injection in CLI wrappers
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal via secret names and argument injection in GPG calls.
**Learning:** CLI tools that wrap other commands (like `pass` or `gpg`) are vulnerable to both path traversal if they use user input for file paths, and argument injection if they don't use the `--` separator.
**Prevention:** Always validate user-supplied names/paths to prevent traversal (reject `..`) and always use the `--` separator before positional arguments in external command calls.
