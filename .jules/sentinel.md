## 2026-01-31 - Path Traversal and Argument Injection in Secrets CLI
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal in `key add` and `vault create` commands allowed arbitrary file writes via manipulated email or vault names. Additionally, missing `--` separators in GPG/Pass wrappers allowed argument injection.
**Learning:** CLI tools that construct file paths from user arguments are susceptible to traversal if not explicitly sanitized. Positional arguments starting with hyphens can also be misinterpreted as flags by underlying tools.
**Prevention:** Use a centralized validation function to reject dangerous characters (`..`, `/`, `\`) and leading hyphens in names. Always use the `--` delimiter to separate options from positional arguments when calling external binaries.
