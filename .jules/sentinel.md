## 2026-02-01 - Argument Injection in CLI Wrappers
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled positional arguments (like emails or secret names) starting with hyphens could be interpreted as flags by underlying CLI tools (`gpg`, `pass`), leading to argument injection.
**Learning:** Wrapping external CLI tools requires careful handling of positional arguments. Even if `exec.Command` prevents shell injection, it doesn't prevent the target binary from misinterpreting arguments as flags.
**Prevention:** Always use the `--` separator to explicitly mark the end of flags and the beginning of positional arguments when calling external binaries with user-provided data.
